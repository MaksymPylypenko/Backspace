It will also have a focus on simplicity and avoiding the extra time it takes to complete the complicated process of contacting a space agency directly.
Since the barrier to spaceflight will be significantly reduced, more people will book spaceflight travel as a result of this easy-to-use app.

### Conclusion
**BackSpace** will be considered a success if the number of space tourists increases by 100% over the next decade.
Since the number of current space tourists is so low, we expect a huge increase in tourists once the barrier to entry is lowered this significantly.
